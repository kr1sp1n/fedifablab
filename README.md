# fedifablab

WIP!

Manage your federated fablab.

The idea is to setup a small server for your fablab
and manage rooms, events, inventory, members, admins and guests.
And trust other instances to build communities of fablabs connected
through the fediverse. Think Mastodon for fablabs.

## Run

```bash
git clone git@github.com:kr1sp1n/fedifablab.git
cd fedifablab
npm i
npm start
```

Goto http://localhost:3000/ and look around.
